# Hacking-as-a-Service
## 01/06/2025
Developing an **Ethical Hacking Lab-as-a-Service** following the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** ensures structured, efficient, and high-quality delivery. Here’s how we can approach this project step-by-step:  

---

### **1. Planning (Requirement Gathering & Feasibility Study)**  

#### **Objectives**  
- Create a cloud-based platform to deploy ethical hacking labs.  
- Provide users with pre-configured environments to practice cybersecurity techniques.  

#### **Requirements**  
- **Functional:**  
  - User Authentication and Role Management.  
  - Deployable labs with vulnerable applications (DVWA, Metasploitable).  
  - Isolated environments for each user.  
  - Usage tracking and reporting.  
- **Non-functional:**  
  - Scalability for multiple users and labs.  
  - Secure deployment using firewalls and encryption.  
  - Cost-effective cloud usage.  

#### **Feasibility Study**  
- **Technical Feasibility:** Use Terraform, Docker, AWS, and Python.  
- **Economic Feasibility:** Start with free-tier AWS services for testing, scale as needed.  
- **Operational Feasibility:** Suitable for cybersecurity enthusiasts, pentesters, and organizations.

### **2. Analysis (Defining System Requirements)**  

#### **Use Cases**  
1. **User Use Case:**  
   - User registers and logs in.  
   - Deploys a vulnerable lab.  
   - Accesses lab via SSH/RDP/VNC.  
   - Completes challenges or tests skills.  

2. **Admin Use Case:**  
   - Manages lab templates and user roles.  
   - Monitors system health and logs.  

#### **System Requirements Specification (SRS)**  
- **User Management:** JWT-based authentication.  
- **Lab Deployment:** Pre-built Docker containers or VMs launched via Terraform.  
- **Logging and Monitoring:** Use ELK or AWS CloudWatch for tracking activities.  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL to store user data, lab configurations, and logs.  
- **Frontend:** React.js for dashboards.

### **3. Design**  

#### **Architecture Diagram**  
Design a **multi-tier architecture**:  

1. **Frontend:**  
   - React.js for user interaction.  
   - Features: Lab management, dashboards, and real-time progress tracking.  

2. **Backend:**  
   - Flask/Django API for handling lab deployments and user management.  

3. **Infrastructure:**  
   - **Terraform:** To provision resources like EC2 instances, VPCs, and security groups.  
   - **Docker:** For containerized lab environments.  
   - **AWS:** Hosting labs in isolated environments.  

#### **Database Schema**  
- **Users Table:** User ID, Name, Email, Role, etc.  
- **Labs Table:** Lab ID, Lab Name, Status, User ID, etc.  
- **Activity Logs Table:** Log ID, User ID, Activity Type, Timestamp, etc.  

#### **System Flow Diagram**  
1. User logs in.  
2. Requests a lab deployment.  
3. Backend triggers Terraform to provision the lab.  
4. Lab credentials are provided to the user.  
5. User interacts with the lab.  
6. Logs and activity are stored for reporting.

### **4. Development**  

#### **Key Modules**  
1. **User Authentication:**  
   - Use Flask/Django for APIs.  
   - Implement OAuth 2.0 or JWT for secure logins.  

2. **Lab Deployment:**  
   - Use Terraform to provision isolated VPCs for labs on AWS.  
   - Use Docker for pre-configured lab environments.  

3. **Frontend Dashboard:**  
   - Create a React.js interface to manage labs, view usage, and access progress reports.  

4. **Logging System:**  
   - Integrate AWS CloudWatch or ELK Stack to log user actions.  

#### **APIs to Build**  
1. `POST /api/login`: Authenticates user.  
2. `GET /api/labs`: Fetches available labs.  
3. `POST /api/labs/create`: Deploys a new lab.  
4. `DELETE /api/labs/{id}`: Terminates a lab.  

---

### **5. Testing**  

#### **Types of Testing**  
1. **Unit Testing:** Test individual modules like lab deployment, user authentication.  
2. **Integration Testing:** Verify that APIs, Terraform, and Docker integrate seamlessly.  
3. **Security Testing:** Ensure labs are isolated and cannot access each other’s environments.  
4. **Performance Testing:** Test system under high lab deployment load.  

#### **Test Cases**  
- **Authentication:** Verify secure login with valid/invalid credentials.  
- **Lab Deployment:** Check if a lab deploys correctly in an isolated environment.  
- **System Logs:** Ensure all user activities are logged accurately.

### **6. Deployment**  

#### **Steps to Deploy**  
1. **Infrastructure Setup:**  
   - Use Terraform scripts to set up AWS resources (EC2, S3, RDS, etc.).  
2. **Backend Deployment:**  
   - Deploy Flask/Django API on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.  
3. **Frontend Deployment:**  
   - Host React.js app on AWS S3 with CloudFront for CDN.  
4. **Lab Environments:**  
   - Deploy labs using Docker on EC2 instances in isolated VPCs.  

#### **Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD):**  
- Use GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment.  

---

### **7. Maintenance**  

1. **Monitoring:**  
   - Use AWS CloudWatch for tracking resource usage and system health.  
   - Set up alerts for high CPU usage or lab deployment failures.  

2. **Updates:**  
   - Periodically update lab templates to include new vulnerabilities and challenges.  

3. **User Feedback:**  
   - Add a feedback form to continuously improve the platform based on user input.  

---

### **Deliverables**  
1. **Terraform Scripts:** Automate cloud resource provisioning.  
2. **Lab Templates:** Pre-built Docker images for vulnerable environments.  
3. **Codebase:** Well-documented Flask/Django and React.js code.  
4. **Demo Video:** Showcase the platform’s features.  
5. **Reports:** System architecture and user guides for deployment and usage.
